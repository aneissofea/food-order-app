# A work in progress
Introduction:
Food order app is the web application that allow users to select the food item and
add them to the cart. The users can also delete the food item from the cart if they
accidentally added them. As we know that all kinds of applications are managed
by admins. So, in this application I have also implemented the functionality for the
admins. Basically, admins can add the new food items and delete them if they are
not available for users to buy.

Goals:
The goal of this project is to create a website allow:
• Users to select their favorite food items from the available food items.
• After selecting the food item, the item will be added to the cart.
• User can view the cart.
• User can also remove the items from the cart if he accidently added them add
can also increase their quantity.
• Admins to add new food items to the menu.
• Admins can also delete the food item from menu, if the item is not available.

Specification:
The web application is divided into two portions. One portion is for Users and other
is for Admins. As I explained above Users can simply select the food items from the
available food items and admins are the one who controls our application. The
admins can add new items to the menu and can remove the item if it is not
available.
