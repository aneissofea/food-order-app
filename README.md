# Introduction:
This simple website was designed by yours truly, using Figma. The site allows users to select the food item and add them to the cart. The users can also delete the food item from the cart if they accidentally added them. As we know that all kinds of applications are managed by admins. So, in this application I have also implemented the functionality for the admins. Basically, admins can add the new food items and delete them if they are not available for users to buy.

# Goals:
The goal of this project is to create a website allow:<br/>
• Users to select their favorite food items from the available food items. <br/>
• After selecting the food item, the item will be added to the cart.<br/>
• User can view the cart.<br/>
• User can also remove the items from the cart if he accidently added them add can also increase their quantity.<br/>
• Admins to add new food items to the menu.<br/>
• Admins can also delete the food item from menu, if the item is not available.

# Specification:
The web application is divided into two portions: Users and Admins. <br/>
• Users can simply select the food items from the available food items and admins are the one who controls our application.  <br/>
• The admins can add new items to the menu and can remove the item if it is not available.

# UI Design
I designed the user interface for both the User Page and Admin Page of this food ordering application, focusing on:

User Page: A clean, user-friendly layout for browsing and managing food items, featuring responsive components for an intuitive user experience.

Admin Page: An organized dashboard tailored for managing the application’s content, including functionality for adding and removing menu items efficiently.
